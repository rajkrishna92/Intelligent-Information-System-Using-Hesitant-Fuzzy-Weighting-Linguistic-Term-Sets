## ABSTRACT
Impreciseness in information sharing is the most complicated and challenging issue and it has been observed that experts’ hesitation in sharing their opinion for rating a state of the system affects the results. Decision-makers are mostly in dilemma state about the weighting criterion of Linguistic terms and their scaling. The weighting criterion needs clarification that on what basses’ linguistic terms are being scaled by decision-makers to conclude the decision. The emergence of Hesitant Fuzzy Weighting Linguistic Term Set (HFLWTS) provides a new platform for decision-makers to conclude their decisions with proper scaling of linguistic terms and weighting criteria. The present paper deals with the design and development of an intelligent information system that runs on the knowledge base of the HFLWTS for computing with words with reference to decision-making phenomena.
